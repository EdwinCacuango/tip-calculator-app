### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to create more clean apps, with less folders or files...or with a better structure, to easy lecture. 

### Useful resources

- [Insert an icon inside a text field, HTML Input](https://desarrolloweb.com/faq/html-con-javascript) - This helped me to fit an icon within inputs element
- [How to delete buttons from numeric inputs](https://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/20484/c%C3%B3mo-eliminar-los-botones-de-un-input-number/20486) - This is an answer in stack overflow, wich help me to hide increment butons of desktop view. That was a default client style for inputs type number.
